# localStorage-contacts-web-app

App description: Using HTML CSS and Javascript, I built a page that displays a list of contact information (sorted alphabetically) saved in localStorage and a pop-up form for adding and editing contacts.
Each item in the list has a button to delete the contact. Adding a contact saves the information in localStorage. Editing an item updates the information in localStorage.
Every time localStorage is updated, the interface is updated to reflect the change in localStorage.
All contact information is saved as a single key in localstorage. When my app starts, check to see if the key exists, if not then create it and add myself as the first contact.
