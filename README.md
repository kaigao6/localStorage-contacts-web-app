# localStorage-contacts-web-app
An HTML page that displays a list of contact information saved in localStorage and a pop-up form for adding and editing contacts. Each item in the list has a button to delete the contact. Adding a contact will save the information in localStorage. Editing an item will update the information in localStorage.
Everytime localStorage is updated, the interface is updated to reflect the change in localStorage.
